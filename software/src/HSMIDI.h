/* Hemisphere Suite Data Packing
 *
 * Hemisphere Suite sysex data is arranged in 8-byte packets. The first
 * byte in each packet is a composite of the high bits of the next
 * seven data bytes.
 *
 * The structure does two basic operations:
 *
 * pack_data() converts an array of sysex data bytes into the packed format,
 * so that it may be transmitted via system exclusive to the appropriate
 * synth.

 * unpack_data() is the opposite operation; it converts a single sysex dump
 * into a series of data bytes, so that the data may be manipulated and/or
 * used to populate a data model.
 *
 * This software is based on my dsi_packing.h library, which was made to
 * manipulate sysex data of Dave Smith Instruments synthesizers. I used the
 * same scheme for Hemisphere because (1) I already had the code and (2) It's
 * probably the most efficient way to pack sysex data, barring of some type
 * of compression. And Teensy really needs efficiency.
