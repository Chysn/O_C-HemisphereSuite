// struct for the global storage of many Turing Machines.
//
// See OC_apps.ino, where an array of Turing Machines has been added
// to the GlobalSettings struct; and then save_global_settings() and Init()
// handle transport to and from the EEPROM. This does a couple things: First,
// it keeps me from having to declare lots of settings in the Enigma app, which
// would be pain. Second, it allows me to use these user Turing Machines in the
// Hemisphere TM applet, because they'll be in HS::user_turing_machines[].
//
// For purposes of data storge, a "TuringMachine" has two data points, a register
// and a length. I decided against making probability an inherent property of
// a Turing Machine so that this can be determined within the application.
//
// For actual usage, a TuringMachineState should be instantiated, which consumes
// and processes a TuringMachine for the purposes of playback.
